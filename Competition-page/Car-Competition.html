            Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS
          </div>
          <div class="raffledescription">
            It has taken a while for Porsche to throw everything it’s got at its smallest sports car,
            the Cayman. In a few years, it’s going purely electric, so it was a case of now or never. 
            Combining the lighter, mid-engined body with the scintillating engine from the Porsche 911 
            GT3 sounds like a recipe for something spectacular, and the result is nothing short of mind-blowing.

          Lamborghini Huracán STO

        <div class="raffledescription">
          You can count on Lamborghini to make something dramatic, but its machines don’t generally go toe to toe with
         GT Porsches for sharpness, poise and trackability. But in a similar twist to the one we’ve seen with the 718 
         Cayman GT4 RS, it seems the engineers have been let off the leash as the Huracán nears the end of its life.

            Porsche 911 GT3 RS

          <div class="raffledescription">
            When the 992 generation of the 911 GT3 first showed its swan-neck rear wing, we wondered whether it
           left any room for an even more hardcore GT3 RS. But you can leave it to Weissach to take the challenge 
           and go overboard with it.
